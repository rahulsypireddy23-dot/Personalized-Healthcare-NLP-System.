# Personalized-Healthcare-NLP-System.
Okay, here's a comprehensive README.md file for your Intelligent Healthcare Assistant project. This README covers the objectives, features, setup, usage, and project structure, making it easy for others (and your future self!) to understand and get started with the project.

Intelligent Healthcare Assistant
Project Overview

This project aims to develop an intelligent healthcare assistant leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), predictive analytics, and explainable AI (XAI) to enhance clinical decision support and reduce administrative burden. The assistant will process unstructured clinical records, predict patient risks, summarize doctor-patient conversations, and provide explainable insights to clinicians.

Key Objectives

Medical History Extraction: Extract structured medical history (diseases, drugs, lab results, timelines) from unstructured clinical notes.

Risk Prediction: Predict patient risks (e.g., heart attack, diabetes, readmission) using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models on both structured and NLP-derived features.

Conversation Summarization: Generate context-aware summaries of doctor-patient interactions, highlighting symptoms, treatment plans, and follow-ups.

Explainable AI: Ensure predictions are interpretable by clinicians using techniques like SHAP and LIME.

Advanced Features

Knowledge Graphs: Link extracted entities to standard medical ontologies (ICD-10, SNOMED CT, RxNorm) for semantic understanding and interoperability.

Temporal Modeling: Capture the patient's longitudinal history to enable more accurate and dynamic risk prediction.

Multi-Modal Integration: Combine textual information with structured data such as lab results, vital signs, and imaging metadata.

Safety Layer: Implement mechanisms to verify generated summaries against extracted entities to mitigate hallucinations and ensure factual accuracy.

Impact

Enhanced Decision Support: Provide clinicians with intelligent, interpretable insights, moving beyond "black-box" AI.

Improved Diagnostic Accuracy: Assist in identifying potential conditions and risks earlier.

Reduced Administrative Burden: Automate routine tasks like summarization and data extraction, freeing up clinician time.

Scalability: Designed for integration into hospital systems (via FHIR) and patient-facing applications.

Setup and Installation
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+

Docker (for containerized deployment)

1. Clone the Repository
code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
git clone https://github.com/your-username/intelligent-healthcare-assistant.git
cd intelligent-healthcare-assistant
2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
python -m venv venv
# On Linux/macOS
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies

Install all required Python packages:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Download spaCy Models

For medical NLP, you'll need specific spaCy and scispaCy models.

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
python -m spacy download en_core_sci_lg # General scientific English model
# For more advanced clinical processing, consider installing a clinical-specific scispaCy model
# pip install https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.5.1/en_core_sci_lg-0.5.1.tar.gz
5. Hugging Face Models

The project utilizes Hugging Face Transformers. The necessary models (e.g., samrawal/bert-base-uncased_clinical-ner, t5-small) will be downloaded automatically by the transformers library on first use. Ensure you have an active internet connection.

Usage
Data Preparation

Place your unstructured clinical records (e.g., .txt files) and structured patient data (e.g., .csv for lab results, vitals) in the data/raw/ directory.

Training the Models (Development Workflow)

Refer to the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory for detailed steps on data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Running the FastAPI Service (API)

The core intelligent assistant logic is exposed via a FastAPI service.

Ensure Models are Trained and Saved:
Make sure your trained NLP and predictive models (e.g., xgboost_model.pkl) are saved in the models/ directory. The src/predictive_models/risk_predictor.py and src/nlp_models/ner_re_model.py scripts should handle saving them.

Start the FastAPI Server:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
uvicorn src.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

The --reload flag is useful for development as it restarts the server on code changes.
Access the API documentation at http://localhost:8000/docs (Swagger UI) or http://localhost:8000/redoc.

Running the Streamlit Dashboard (UI)

A demo Streamlit dashboard (src/ui/app.py) provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the FastAPI service.

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
streamlit run src/ui/app.py

This will open the dashboard in your web browser, typically at http://localhost:8501.

Docker Deployment

For production or easy sharing, the application can be containerized using Docker.

1. Build the Docker Image
code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
docker build -t healthcare-assistant .
2. Run the Docker Container

This will expose the FastAPI service on port 8000 and the Streamlit UI on port 8501 (if the Dockerfile also includes Streamlit, which it should for a complete demo).

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
docker run -p 8000:8000 -p 8501:8501 healthcare-assistant

Now, the FastAPI documentation will be available at http://localhost:8000/docs, and the Streamlit app at http://localhost:8501.

FHIR Integration

The FastAPI service is designed to be readily integrable with Electronic Health Records (EHRs) that support the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard. Endpoints can be developed to consume FHIR resources (e.g., Observation, Condition, MedicationRequest) as input and provide insights back, or to expose predictions in a FHIR-compatible format. This project provides the intelligent core, which can be wrapped with FHIR adapters as needed.
